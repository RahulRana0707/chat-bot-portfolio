# The Art of Design Systems

In the world of frontend development, consistency is king. A well-crafted design system isn't just about making things look pretty—it's about creating a shared language between designers and developers.

## Why You Need One

When you're building a small project, you can get away with hardcoding values. `margin-top: 20px` here, `color: #333` there. But as your application grows, this approach becomes a nightmare.

> "A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications."

## Key Components

1. **Design Tokens**: The smallest atoms of your system (colors, spacing, typography).
2. **Component Library**: Reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs, modals).
3. **Documentation**: Usage guidelines and best practices.

## Example: A React Button

Here's how a button component might look in a modern design system using Tailwind and React:

<CodeBlock lang="tsx" filename="components/Button.tsx" code={`import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-ring disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground shadow hover:bg-primary/90",
        destructive: "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-destructive/90",
        outline: "border border-input bg-transparent shadow-sm hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-9 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-8 rounded-md px-3 text-xs",
        lg: "h-10 rounded-md px-8",
        icon: "h-9 w-9",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);`} />

By standardizing these components, we ensure that every button in our application looks and behaves the same way. This not only improves the user experience but also dramatically speeds up development time.
