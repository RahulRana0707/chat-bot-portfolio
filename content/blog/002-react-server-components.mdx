# Understanding React Server Components

React Server Components (RSC) represent the biggest shift in the React ecosystem since hooks. They allow us to write components that run exclusively on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.

## The Problem with Client-Side Rendering

In a traditional SPA, the browser has to download a massive bundle of JavaScript before it can render anything interactive. This leads to slower initial load times and poor SEO.

## Enter RSC

With Server Components, we can render complex UI on the server and stream it to the client as HTML.

<CodeBlock lang="tsx" filename="app/page.tsx" code={`async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
 
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </main>
  );
}`} />

Notice how we can make the component `async` and fetch data directly? No `useEffect`, no loading states to manage manually. It's a game changer.

## Benefits

- **Zero Bundle Size**: Server components aren't included in the client bundle.
- **Direct Backend Access**: Query your database directly from your components.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Client components imported by server components are automatically code-split.

RSCs are not a replacement for Client Components, but a complement. Use Server Components for data fetching and layout, and Client Components for interactivity.
