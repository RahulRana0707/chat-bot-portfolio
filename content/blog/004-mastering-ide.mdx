# Mastering Your IDE

Your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is your lightsaber. A master Jedi knows their weapon inside and out. For most web developers today, that weapon is VS Code.

## Essential Shortcuts

- `Cmd + P`: Quick open files.
- `Cmd + Shift + F`: Global search.
- `Cmd + D`: Multi-cursor selection (keep pressing to select next occurrence).
- `Opt + Up/Down`: Move lines up or down.

## Top Extensions

1. **ESLint / Prettier**: Non-negotiable for code quality.
2. **GitLens**: Supercharge your git workflow.
3. **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: Autocomplete for utility classes.
4. **Vi Keybindings**: If you're brave enough to learn Vim motions.

## Configuring your Settings

Don't stick with the defaults. Customize your editor to fit your workflow.

<CodeBlock lang="json" filename="settings.json" code={`{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code', monospace",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'MesloLGS NF'",
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Tokyo Night",
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false
}`} />

Investing time in your tooling pays reliable dividends.
