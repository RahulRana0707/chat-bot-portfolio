# The Rise of the AI Engineer

We are witnessing a paradigm shift. Just as mobile and cloud computing defined the last decade, Artificial Intelligence is defining this one. But there's a new role emerging: the AI Engineer.

## What is an AI Engineer?

An AI Engineer isn't necessarily a machine learning researcher building new models from scratch. Instead, they are software engineers who know how to *apply* existing AI models to solve real-world problems.

They bridge the gap between research and product.

## The Toolkit

1. **LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini.
2. **Vector Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus.
3. **Frameworks**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vercel AI SDK.

## Building a Chatbot

Here's a simple example of how easy it is to stream a response using the Vercel AI SDK:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" code={`import { OpenAIStream, StreamingTextResponse } from 'ai';
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai-edge';

const config = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(config);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    stream: true,
    messages,
  });
  const stream = OpenAIStream(response);
  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);
}`} />

## The Future

As models get cheaper and faster, we'll see AI embedded in every part of the software stack. From better autocomplete to fully autonomous agents, the possibilities are endless.
